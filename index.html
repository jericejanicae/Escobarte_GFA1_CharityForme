        <p>
            Cancer is spontaneous, unexpected, and most importantly, blind. That means it can happen to anyone, including those who you love, and yourself. People should support cancer research to help save 10 million people from dying each year, and the people whose lives are plagued by cancer currently and in the future.
        <p>
            For me, personally, it is in my best interests to help fight against breast cancer as my relatives have fallen to this disease, which means that I have a higher risk to succumbing to the cancer as it is in my genes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Donating to cancer research can not only defeat just cancer, but related diseases and illnesses as knowledge expands, knowledge that can be used to cure other currently "untreatable" diseases.
